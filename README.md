# Current dotfiles

Current dotfiles configuration. 

The configuration files are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which automatically setups the symlinks for all the dotfiles with the following command:

```
stow .
```

Currently holds configurations for:

- `nvim`: text editor
- `tmux`: terminal multiplexer
- `bash`: shell
